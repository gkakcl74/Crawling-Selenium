# Crawling-Selenium
Automatically download images using selenium
1. firlst index.py is a Crawling that takes words and automatically writes them on a notebook.
2. number two, google.py has the ability to automatically download images that Google wants to find.

This functionality works only on chrome and works normally only when chromedriver.exe and google.py are stored in the same folder.
