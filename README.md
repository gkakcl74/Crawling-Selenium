# :fireworks: Crawling-Selenium 
Simple program to download images automatically using selenium

1. index.py is a Crawling that takes words and automatically writes them on a notebook.
2. google.py has the ability to automatically download images that Google wants to find.
3. This functionality works only on chrome and works normally only when chromedriver.exe and google.py are stored in the same folder. 

### If you use index.py well, you can bring a lot of materials, so try it out.
